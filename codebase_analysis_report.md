# Macro Sentiment Trading Project - Codebase Analysis Report ## Overview This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the macro sentiment trading project codebase, identifying issues that need to be addressed before deployment. Issues are categorized by severity and component. ## Critical Issues () ### Security 1. **Exposed Credentials**: - `macro-sentiment-trading-02d62df7e52d.json` is in `.gitignore` but physically present in repository - `.env` file is not in `.gitignore` - Potential API keys in `api_keys_setup.md` examples ### Configuration 1. **Future Date References**: - `src/main.py` (line 12) references date range to 2025-04-30 (future date) - Conflicting date ranges between `cli/config.py` (2024-12-31) and `src/main.py` (2025-04-30) ### Model Persistence 1. **Missing Model Persistence**: - No mechanism to save trained models for reuse - No model versioning system - No model loading functionality for inference - `results/models/` directory exists but no code saves models there ## High Severity Issues () ### Data Validation 1. **Insufficient Input Validation**: - No validation for input data quality or format - Missing date range validation - Limited error handling in main pipeline - No data freshness checks ### Dependency Management 1. **Version Conflicts**: - `requirements.txt` has torch>=2.0.0, `setup.py` has torch>=1.9.0 - Dependencies use >= instead of == (reproducibility issues) - Optional dependencies not isolated - Docker uses Python 3.8-slim but code may use 3.9+ features ### Error Handling 1. **Limited Error Recovery**: - No health check endpoint - Unstructured logging (547 print/logger statements) - No alerting mechanism for failed jobs - Inconsistent circuit breaker application ### Testing 1. **Insufficient Testing Framework**: - No automated tests for deployment validation - Many test files but no CI/CD integration - No integration tests for end-to-end pipeline - No data pipeline validation tests ## Medium Severity Issues () ### API Usage 1. **Rate Limiting Concerns**: - No documented GDELT API rate limiting strategy - Yahoo Finance could hit rate limits on large date ranges - No batching limits for FinBERT inference ### Resource Management 1. **Unbounded Resource Usage**: - No memory limits for FinBERT model - No disk space checks - No GPU memory management - Unbounded cache growth ### Production Readiness 1. **Deployment Concerns**: - No rollback mechanism - No feature flags - No A/B testing capability - No canary deployment support ## Component-Specific Issues ### Data Collection Pipeline 1. **GDELT Collector**: - Error handling exists but recovery is limited - No validation for returned data quality - Circuit breaker implementation incomplete ### Sentiment Analysis 1. **FinBERT Integration**: - No fallback for model loading failures - Caching mechanism could grow unbounded - No validation of sentiment scores ### Feature Engineering 1. **Feature Pipeline**: - No validation of feature counts - No handling for missing features - No feature importance tracking ### Model Training 1. **ModelTrainer**: - No early stopping mechanism - No hyperparameter optimization - No model persistence implementation ### CLI Interface 1. **Command Line Interface**: - Limited validation of user inputs - No progress reporting for long-running operations - No dry-run option ## Recommendations ### Immediate Fixes (Critical) 1. Remove credential files from repository 2. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` 3. Fix future date references 4. Implement model save/load functionality ### High Priority Fixes 1. Add comprehensive input validation 2. Reconcile and pin dependency versions 3. Implement structured logging and monitoring 4. Create basic test suite for core components ### Medium Priority Improvements 1. Add resource management controls 2. Implement API rate limiting strategies 3. Add deployment tooling and documentation 4. Create performance benchmarks ## Next Steps This report will guide the implementation of fixes according to the AI-Powered Project Testing and Deployment Preparation plan. Each issue will be addressed systematically, starting with the critical security and configuration concerns.
